 Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining. Today's meeting is about developing the new business website for ACME Corporation. Our goal is to finalize a website scope, assign key tasks, and set deadlines to ensure a smooth execution. Let's start with the requirements. Himanshu, from a marketing perspective, what's the most important feature for the site? Thanks, Aarushi. The website must be user-friendly, mobile responsive, and SEO-optimized. We need a clear and compelling landing page with a strong call to action, a dedicated service action to highlight our offerings, and a well-maintained blog for content maintaining and SEO. Additionally, seamless integration with a social media platform like LinkedIn, Twitter, and Instagram is essential to drive engagement and visibility. Got it. That aligns with our business goals. Vibhuti, from a development standpoint, what technology staff do you recommend for this project? So, I suggest using React.js for the front-end and Node.js with Express for the back-end to ensure a dynamic and responsive user experience. We can use MongoDB as the database to allow scalability and flexibility. The site will be hosted on AWS for high availability and security. I'll also implement Google Lighthouse recommendations to optimize paid speed, SEO, and accessibility. Additionally, we should prioritize mobile-first design since a large portion of our users will access the site from the smartphones. That sounds great. One crucial aspect we need to include is our lead capture form that seamlessly connects to our CRM. Can you handle that? Yes. I will create a custom form using React and integrate it with HubSpot CRM via API to ensure we capture leads efficiently and automate follow-ups. Perfect. Now let's assign tasks with deadlines to keep everything on track. Himanshu, you'll be responsible for providing all the content, company details, service descriptions, and initial log drafts by April 5, 2025. Vibhuti, you'll start working on the homepage layout and lead capture form with the first draft ready by April 8. I will define the complete project roadmap including milestones and testing strategy by April 6 and ensure that we monitor progress effectively. Once the initial drafts are ready, we'll conduct an internal review on April 10, 2025. Does this timeline work for everyone? Yes. Sounds good. Yes. Sounds good. Great. Any concerns before we wrap up? No concerns from my side. None from my speaker. Alright. Our next meeting is scheduled for April 7, where we will review initial progress. Let's stay aligned with the deadlines and make this website a success. Thank you everyone. Thank you.
